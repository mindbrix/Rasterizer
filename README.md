Rasterizer
========

Rasterizer is a GPU-accelerated 2D vector graphics engine designed for simplicity, efficiency and portability. 

The current implementation targets macOS using C++ 11 and Metal, but it will work on any GPU that supports instancing and floating point render targets.


Building
--------

The Xcode demo app project builds out of the box as all dependencies are included. For best performance, select the Run Rasterizer scheme.


Demo App
-------

The demo app can open SVG and PDF files. Use to -/+ keys to select PDF pages. Other key mappings are shown on the HUD top left.

Use the trackpad and/or mouse to drag and zoom/rotate the canvas around its center. Hold the `Shift` key to zoom/rotate around the pointer.

A single font is used, settable via the fonts panel (`<Cmd>T`).

Architecture
--------

`Path` objects follow the Postscript model, with the same even-odd and non-zero fill rules. Stroking is also supported.

`Scene` objects group `Path` objects together with their draw parameters: color, affine transform, stroke width (0 for a fill, +ve for user space, -ve for device space), flags (fill rule, end caps etc.) and an optional clip bounds.

For rendering, `SceneList` objects group `Scene` objects together with their draw parameters: affine transform and an optional clip bounds.

Filled paths are rasterized in 2 stages: first to a float mask buffer, then to the color buffer. 

Small screen space fills (e.g. glyphs) are optimal, as raw `Path` geometry can be `memcpy`ed into GPU memory. 

Larger fills use a fat scanlines algorithm on clipped, device-space `Path` geometry. 

Pixel area coverage is calculated using a novel windowed-inverse-lerp algorithm.

Stroked paths are rasterized straight to the color buffer using GPU triangulation.

Quadratic Bezi√©r curves are solved on the GPU, enabling coarse curve geometry.

The CPU stages use simple batch parallelism for efficiency.

The GPU holds no state. Frames are written afresh to double-buffered shared memory. In practice, `memcpy` is cheaper than managing GPU-resident `Path` objects in a parallel context.
